Dump of my projects for MIT 6.172 Performance Engineering for Software Systems which I took in Fall 2018.

All the projects are in C and were done in a team of two except the last one which was done in a team of four.

Project 1: using bithacks to shift n array of bits.

Project 2: open ended collision detection program.

Project 3: implementing a memory allocator.

Project 4: optimizing an AI playing a customized version of Khet.
